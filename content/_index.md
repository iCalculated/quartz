# Defying Entropy

Welcome to my digital garden. 

I'll be putting all of my side project learning this month here.

## Posts

- [Day 0: Terms ~~& Conditions~~](projects/00.md)
- [Day 1: Garden Setup](projects/01.md)
- [Day 2: Garden Configuration](projects/02.md)
- [Day 3: JavaScript `reduce` Interlude](projects/03.md)
- *Day 4 soon to come...*

## Why?

There are a lot of things I want to be able to do as a programmer.

For some reason, certainly not lack of time, I haven't even explored all of them.

I figure that a social group would be the best source of motivation but making my learning public is apparently easier than finding like-minded *unattached*[^caveat] people to talk to.

## Wiki

[Here](wiki/wiki_moc.md) is where I am storing the miscellaneous notes on the technologies I work with.

[^caveat]: I'm part of several online programming communities (my favorite being [Slingshot](https://slingshotahead.com/)) but I find that for the large majority such groups are supplements to their existing peer groups. It's hard to compete with local friends.
