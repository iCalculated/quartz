# Day 4:  Changing `config.toml` for Fun and Profit

[Active Link!](quartz.defyingentropy.ml)

Once again, small time investment. 

## Goal

Mess around with some Hugo settings.

That'll involve writing some notes in [hugo](wiki/hugo.md) as I figure out how Hugo works.

## Graph

I recolored my graph based on whether a page is in projects or the wiki. Colors were chosen arbitrarily but will likely be changed.

I'd like to enable the legend at some point but without styling I think it's a bit too clunky: ![](projects/images/Pasted%20image%2020210804221000.png)
Actually, I lied. I like it and will be keeping it (but contemplate restyling).

In terms of [Quartz customization](wiki/quartz.md#Customization) there isn't a ton more to do, I filled in the fields in `data/me.yaml` and `data/config.yaml` (not to be confused with `config.toml`) when I first made the site.

## Fixes

There are some style things that need to be fixed, like the day-night toggle appearing for a second then getting reflowed which I detest. Probably going to fix them on a per-issue basis and not write about it unless if something interesting happens.

## Styling

I learned that I can assign custom attributes to my markdown by putting `.{attributeName}` after a block or title. Could use that to implement [admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition) blocks.

## Comments

I want to add a comment section, mostly because I can. However, Hugo makes it so easy (at least until something with my theme breaks) that it's probably not trying out. Pragmatically, I don't think that a comment section would change anything. If you feel the need to reach me then send an email and if you want to reach the world then

1. My tiny garden is a bad place to do that and
2. Start your own.

## Reflection

I didn't work on this much today. Need to reflect on my time management more than anything. I think that a clear idea of what I want to implement will help with that.[^vague] 

I'm going to sleep rather than getting my last two brain cells to come up with things to do then try to execute.

## TODO

I recently came across Comma AI's [Calibration Challenge](https://github.com/commaai/calib_challenge). It seems very difficult but it's also a great opportunity to take a deep dive into a problem and potentially get the chance to work on a hard problem with smart people via internship. I'm not sure how I can break it down into pieces. Also, would be hard to ship anything. Definitely something I'll be keeping in mind though.

[^vague]:I say as my already-written TODO section features a really vague idea.
