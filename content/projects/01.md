# Day 1: Technical Blog

[Active Link!](defyingentropy.ml)[^active]

## Goal

Today my goal was to set-up a digital garden.[^blog]

I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for all of my note-taking recently and I really like the graph-based structure.

Obsidian offers a built-in publishing option, but it requires a premium subscription. As such, I'm using [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0)'s [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), an alternative hosted via GitHub pages.

## Execution

This was meant to be an easy project for day 1 of August. Since I'm mentioning that, it obviously wasn't.

Quartz is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. I've previously used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and while the general ideas carried over I still had to refer to the docs frequently.

My first challenge was getting a local preview working. It was relatively easy to install Hugo but one of the coolest features of Quartz[^mind] is the interactive graph at the bottom of the page:

Getting it running required using a Go module, `hugo-obsidian`, that converted the local links to something Hugo can understand. That was relatively easy to set up, at least after I realized that for some reason my Go installation did not update the path, but I had some strange issues with dead links being generated. In the end, I didn't do anything clever, I just recreated the Obsidian workspace. I even reached out to Jacky but found my hacky solution before he responded.

After minor configuration to activate GitHub workflows (pre-written by Jacky) I had a publically available site! That's when it all went wrong:

## Frills


### Prettification (Attempt)

Instead of focusing on the content and organization, I decided it was time to work on the aesthetics. Now, I don't know much about CSS or HTML, that's part of why I'm doing this exploration. After ~~stalking~~ investigating Jacky's other work I found out that he has a [personal site](https://jzhao.xyz/) that looks *amazing*. I just had to have that fancy 3D graph render on the right.

After ~~blatantly copy-pasting~~ recreating the script,[^disclosure] my website looks like this

> *As you can see, things are* not *as they should be.*

It's a work in progress. I'll figure it out.

### Domain

Who wants a URL like `icalculated.github.io` when you can have something that ends with `.xyz`? Not me! I considered purchasing a `.xyz` domain but then decided that I should try and win one for free at a MLH event in the future. Instead, I went with the tried and true solution, Freenom. 

I am now the proud owner of `defyingentropy.ml`. It's free for twelve months but 10 dollars for a year oddly enough. I think you can guess which one I chose. Freenom's DNS configuration is somewhat *jank* to put it lightly but Github has great docs and I've done it before. 

Didn't go as planned... Hugo takes a domain name, the workflow does, and then I added a CNAME (two actually, both at the root and in the `/static/` directory) for good measure. I figure at least one of those must be working. However, I'm having a very difficult time determining if the issue is on my side since Freenom keeps consuming the records that I create. I am trying to use `dig` to troubleshoot but it's not finding any records which suggests that maybe I'm being impatient and should just wait for DNS propogation. I'll check in on that tomorrow.

## Reflection

This venture is already some combination of a trainwreck and a dumpster-fire. I'm having a great time! I think that rather than moving on to a new project tomorrow I'll be touching up some of the difficulties from today, working on the styling, and generally exploring further. 

I'm thinking that major projects will be confined to the weekends since I'm working at least 40 hours a week,[^like] at least until I get into the groove. I'm going to try and figure out each day's project the day before so that ideas have some time to percolate.

If I somehow find myself at a loss tomorrow, I'll probably try to work through a chapter of *Eloquent Javascript*.


[^active]:As I write this, the link is not active. However, if you can see it then it will be.
[^blog]: A blog but with more focus on the process of creating it than the result.
[^mind]:Perhaps I'm easily impressed.
[^disclosure]: I am using his code, at this point it's difficult enough for me to just implement it and he said it's free to use with credit.
[^like]: Being a software developer is awesome so sometimes I end up working more. Since I get to work on interesting projects for work I don't expect to reallocate that time to side projects.
