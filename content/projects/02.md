# Day 2: Technical Blog, Revision

[Active Link!](quartz.defyingentropy.ml)

It's a bit later than I'd like, so this will *hopefully* be succinct (read: there will be extensive rambling and minimal content).

## Goal

My goal today was to touch up some of the things that didn't go so well yesterday, namely my domain, the site organization, and the fancy CSS stuff.

## Domain

So here is how `defyingentropy.ml` is doing:

> *Not off to a good start?*

Just kidding, I am hosting my blog at the `quartz.` subdomain!

![My blog, working as it should be.](projects/images/Pasted%20image%2020210802220529.png)
> *Everything working as it should be*

I didn't need to do a ton on this front. After about 30 hours I checked the DNS records with `dig` and actually got a result

> *All is well, except for  Arcturus'[^star] battery.*

At that point, my site worked just fine.

I'm considering migrating to the apex domain since I'm not actually using it for anything (yet?) but I don't currently have the mental fortitude to do that.

## Structure

I have updated the structure of my site. My index page now actually features a list of posts, which I might update to generate procedurally and some pseudo-philosophical rambling.

## CSS

The bulk of today's work time was spent trying to transform my site from the atrocious mess it was yesterday to something better looking. 

Doing so required taking a deep dive into Firefox's development tools. Using them to reverse engineer Jacky's CSS was actually quite an educational experience. I now have a much better grasp of how properties are inherited from stylesheets but I don't quite understand how CSS interacts with Hugo.

I first managed to center the text and actually make the `descriptor` field appear, that was a good start.

Then, with some borrowed CSS from Jacky I got the rotations with color working!

## Reflection

I made good progress today but also invested less time in the project than expected. 

My main learning experience was the CSS, I think my "messing around until something works" approach actually went pretty well. When I'm creating something from scratch I should probably actually read docs first though. I'm sure that I've done some unintelligent stuff with my CSS, such as having `/assets/title.scss` that exists exclusively to make the title page on my index smarter. I probably should have implemented a class or something. I have not figured out how Jacky does it without making all `h1` fields large.

I'm very happy to have something I can provide a (working!) link to.

Tomorrow I'm expecting to have a similar amount of time so I'm going to read more about Hugo and customize things to better suit me. Hopefully it'll be the final day I spend working on the garden exclusively.
