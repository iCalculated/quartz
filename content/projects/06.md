# Day 6: Automating the Boring Stuff

## Goal

For work I need to scrape some information. That would be a rather arduous task and your boy is lazy so I'm writing a scraper to do it for me. Using JS since I need to hone my skills and may even translate it to TS. I've written most of the base scraper (at least an MVP) and some of the full post but I've been asked to get a in-company review before publishing. Thus, this post will be updated by Monday evening.


Create a scraping application that given a name can determine type of venue, location (address, longitude, latitude), relevant tags, hours, and images.

JS
Yelp
argument unwrapping
API req/sec
	nested await
	reduce
	
hours array
run repeatedly?

phone, display_phone, rating, price, photos (extended), Yelp url
