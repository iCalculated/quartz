It&amp;rsquo;s a bit later than I&amp;rsquo;d like, so this will hopefully be succinct (read: there will be extensive rambling and minimal content).
Goal My goal today was to touch up some of the things that didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well yesterday, namely my domain, the site organization, and the fancy CSS stuff.
Domain So here is how defyingentropy.ml is doing:
Not off to a good start?</description></item><item><title>Day 1</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/01/</guid><description>Day 1: Technical Blog Active Link! 1
Goal Today my goal was to set-up a digital garden.2
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Obsidian for all of my note-taking recently and I really like the graph-based structure.
My current Obsidian knowledge graph. Currently monochrome but I spend an embarassing amount of time grouping and tweaking it.
Obsidian offers a built-in publishing option, but it requires a premium subscription. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m using Jacky Zhao &amp;rsquo;s Quartz , an alternative hosted via GitHub pages.</description></item><item><title>Day 0</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/00/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/00/</guid><description>Day 0: My Goal Terms I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that every day in the month of August I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and ship something, preferably exploring a variety of frameworks and disciplines.
Tentatively, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to meet the following criteria every day:
Create a publically accessible project demo and codebase Write about the process of creating it Avoid using tutorials or guides in favor of documentation1 I expect to discover that these conditions will be untenable within a week and will modify the conditions as required.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/wiki/hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/wiki/hugo/</guid><description>Hugo Frontmatter Title is required.
Hugo Obsidian Used to generate graph and interactive links:
1 hugo-obsidian -input=content -output=data Run Can server locally with

Built on Hugo , pages live in the content directory so I just symlinked my vault.
Home page lives in content/_index.md by default.
Colors can be edited in assets/custom.scss.
Image links should be prefixed with /. (untested)

These pages are for my own benefit and are going to be even less polished than my actual posts.
You have been warned.
