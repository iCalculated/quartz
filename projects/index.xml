That would be a rather arduous task and your boy is lazy so I&amp;rsquo;m writing a scraper to do it for me. Using JS since I need to hone my skills and may even translate it to TS. I&amp;rsquo;ve written most of the base scraper (at least an MVP) and some of the full post but I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to get a in-company review before publishing.</description></item><item><title>Day 5</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/05/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/05/</guid><description>Day 5: Comma and EJS Goal Scope out the calibration challenge Do some Eloquent Javascript for content Comma AI Challenge I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly looked into the ML side of things since there are a lot of options there. Definitely need to research some deep math because I think an expert system would be better given the limited training set (5 videos).
It&amp;rsquo;s cool to read about fancy ML stuff though, so here are some repos I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at:</description></item><item><title>Day 4</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/04/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/04/</guid><description>Day 4: Changing config.toml for Fun and Profit Active Link! Once again, small time investment.
Goal Mess around with some Hugo settings.
That&amp;rsquo;ll involve writing some notes in hugo as I figure out how Hugo works.
Graph I recolored my graph based on whether a page is in projects or the wiki. Colors were chosen arbitrarily but will likely be changed.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to enable the legend at some point but without styling I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit too clunky: Actually, I lied.</description></item><item><title>Day 3</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/03/</guid><description>Day 3: JavaScript Surprise Interlude This article was written quickly and lazily. If any of my statements seems dubious that&amp;rsquo;s probably because they are.
Goal Rambling It would be cool to get a JS environment running on my site like Eloquent Javascript does or something but this is a last-minute cop out since I was unexpectedly busy today.
Maybe that&amp;rsquo;ll be on tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blog improvements TODO list.
Cop Out Functional Programming If you&amp;rsquo;re not already a functioning1programming enthusiast, the following paragraphs might turn you off it.</description></item><item><title>Day 2</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/02/</guid><description>Day 2: Technical Blog, Revision Active Link! It&amp;rsquo;s a bit later than I&amp;rsquo;d like, so this will hopefully be succinct (read: there will be extensive rambling and minimal content).
Goal My goal today was to touch up some of the things that didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well yesterday, namely my domain, the site organization, and the fancy CSS stuff.
Domain So here is how defyingentropy.ml is doing:
Not off to a good start?</description></item><item><title>Day 1</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/01/</guid><description>Day 1: Technical Blog Active Link! 1
Goal Today my goal was to set-up a digital garden.2
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Obsidian for all of my note-taking recently and I really like the graph-based structure.
My current Obsidian knowledge graph. Currently monochrome but I spend an embarassing amount of time grouping and tweaking it.
Obsidian offers a built-in publishing option, but it requires a premium subscription. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m using Jacky Zhao &amp;rsquo;s Quartz , an alternative hosted via GitHub pages.</description></item><item><title>Day 0</title><link>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/00/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.defyingentropy.ml/projects/00/</guid><description>Day 0: My Goal Terms I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that every day in the month of August I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and ship something, preferably exploring a variety of frameworks and disciplines.
Tentatively, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to meet the following criteria every day:
Create a publically accessible project demo and codebase Write about the process of creating it Avoid using tutorials or guides in favor of documentation1 I expect to discover that these conditions will be untenable within a week and will modify the conditions as required.</description></item></channel></rss>
